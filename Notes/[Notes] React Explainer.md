  - [00:02] Developed at FaceBook and released in 2013, it's safe to say React has been the most influential UI library of recent memory.
  - [00:10] We use it to build components that represent logical reusable parts of the UI.

  - [00:20] It's just a JavaScript function.
  - [00:22] [B-Roll] "it's so easy a caveman could do it"
  - [00:24] The return value from this function is your HTML, or UI, which is written in a special syntax called JSX; allowing you to easily combine JavaScript with HTML markup.
  - [00:33] If you want to pass data into a component; you simply pass it a props argument, which you can then reference inside the function body, or in the UI using braces.
  - [00:41] If the value changes, React will react to update the UI.
  - [00:43] If we want to give our component its own internal state, we can use the state hook.
  - [00:49] The hook is just a function that returns a value, as well as a function to change the value.
  - [00:53] In this case; `count` is our reactive state, and `setCount` will change the state.
  - [00:58] When used in the template, the `count` will always show the most recent value.
  - [01:01] Then we can bind `setCount` to a button click event, so the user can change the state.
  - [01:05] React provides a variety of other built-in hooks to handle common use cases.
  - [01:09] But the main reason you might want to use React is not the library itself, but the massive ecosystem that surrounds it.
  - [01:14] React itself doesn't care about routing, state management, animation, or anything like that.
  - [01:19] Instead it lets those concerns evolve naturally within the open source community.
  - [01:22] No matter what you're trying to do, there's very likely a good supporting library to help you get it done.
  - [01:26] Need a static site? You have Gatsby.
  - [01:28] Need server side rendering? You have Next.
  - [01:30] For animation you have Spring.
  - [01:32] For forms you have Formic.
  - [01:33] State management you've got Redux, MobX, Flux, Recoil, XState, and more.
  - [01:36] You have an endless supply of choices to get things done, the way you like it.
  - [01:41] As an added bonus, once you have React down you can easily jump into React Native and start building mobile apps.
  - [01:45] And it's no surprise that knowing this little UI library is one of the most in-demand skills for front-end developers today.
  - [01:49] This has been React in 100 seconds.

  ### What Is It
[00:00] React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
[00:02] Developed at FaceBook and released in 2013, it's safe to say React has been the most influential UI library of recent memory.
[00:10] We use it to build components that represent logical reusable parts of the UI.
[00:15] The beauty of React is that the simplicity of building a component has been brought down to its theoretical minimum.
[00:20] It's just a JavaScript function.

  ### How Does It Work
[00:24] The return value from this function is your HTML, or UI, which is written in a special syntax called JSX; allowing you to easily combine JavaScript with HTML markup.
[00:33] If you want to pass data into a component; you simply pass it a props argument, which you can then reference inside the function body, or in the UI using braces.
[00:41] If the value changes, React will react to update the UI.
[00:43] If we want to give our component its own internal state, we can use the state hook.
[00:49] The hook is just a function that returns a value, as well as a function to change the value.
[00:53] In this case; `count` is our reactive state, and `setCount` will change the state.
[00:58] When used in the template, the `count` will always show the most recent value.
[01:01] Then we can bind `setCount` to a button click event, so the user can change the state.
[01:05] React provides a variety of other built-in hooks to handle common use cases.

  ### Ecosystem
[01:09] But the main reason you might want to use React is not the library itself, but the massive ecosystem that surrounds it.
[01:14] React itself doesn't care about routing, state management, animation, or anything like that.
[01:19] Instead it lets those concerns evolve naturally within the open source community.

[01:36] You have an endless supply of choices to get things done, the way you like it.

  ### Additional Features/Benefits
[01:41] As an added bonus, once you have React down you can easily jump into React Native and start building mobile apps.
[01:45] And it's no surprise that knowing this little UI library is one of the most in-demand skills for front-end developers today.

  ### Wrap-Up, Calls To Action
[01:49] This has been React in 100 seconds.
