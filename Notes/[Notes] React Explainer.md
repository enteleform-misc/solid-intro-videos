  - [00:00] react, a javascript library for building user interfaces
  - [00:02] developed at facebook and released in 2013 it's safe to say react has been the most influential ui library of recent memory
  - [00:10] we use it to build components that represent logical reusable parts of the ui
  - [00:15] the beauty of react is that the simplicity of building a component has been brought down to its theoretical minimum
  - [00:20] it's just a javascript function 
  - [00:22] [B-Roll] "it's so easy a caveman could do it"
  - [00:24] the return value from this function is your html or ui which is written in a special syntax called jsx, allowing you to easily combine javascript with html markup
  - [00:33] if you want to pass data into a component you simply pass it a props argument which you can then reference inside the function body or in the ui using braces
  - [00:41] if the value changes react will react to update the ui
  - [00:43] if we want to give our component its own internal state, we can use the state hook
  - [00:49] the hook is just a function that returns a value as well as a function to change the value
  - [00:53] in this case count is our reactive state and setcount will change the state
  - [00:58] when used in the template the count will always show the most recent value
  - [01:01] then we can bind set count to a button click event so the user can change the state
  - [01:05] react provides a variety of other built-in hooks to handle common use cases
  - [01:09] but the main reason you might want to use react is not the library itself but the massive ecosystem that surrounds it
  - [01:14] react itself doesn't care about routing, state management, animation, or anything like that
  - [01:19] instead it lets those concerns evolve naturally within the open source community
  - [01:22] no matter what you're trying to do there's very likely a good supporting library to help you get it done
  - [01:26] need a static site you have gatsby
  - [01:28] need server side rendering you have next
  - [01:30] for animation you have spring 
  - [01:32] for forms you have formic 
  - [01:33] state management you've got redux mobx flux recoil x state and more
  - [01:36] you have an endless supply of choices to get things done the way you like it
  - [01:41] as an added bonus once you have react down you can easily jump into react native and start building mobile apps
  - [01:45] and it's no surprise that knowing this little ui library is one of the most in-demand skills for front-end developers today
  - [01:49] this has been react in 100 seconds
